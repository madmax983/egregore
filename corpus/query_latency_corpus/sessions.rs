//! Repo-scoped, recency-ordered digest of recent agent sessions (issue #112).
//!
//! Answers "what did agents recently do in this repository?" from records that
//! already exist: one row per live `AgentSession` whose members cite code in the
//! selected repository, ordered by last activity descending, carrying the
//! agent/session handles, time bounds, run outcomes, referenced tasks, and
//! per-kind record counts.
//!
//! Everything here is an AGENT CLAIM. A row states what an agent recorded, never
//! that the work happened, that a task completed, or that code works. Task
//! status is a recorded project-domain fact carried through verbatim, not a
//! correctness judgement.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The pure core is transport-agnostic: it consumes an append-ordered record
//! slice (a `--graph` JSONL or an embedded current-state read) and every
//! intermediate collection is a `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`, so output is byte
//! identical across runs and across transports. Membership is EDGE-DERIVED only
//! — a matching `session_id` string is not membership — and all timestamp
//! ordering is by parsed UTC instant, never raw RFC 3339 string order.
