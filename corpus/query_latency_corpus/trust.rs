//! Derived per-record trust classes for cross-domain context answers (issue #114).
//!
//! # Domain is not trust
//!
//! Every record already carries a `domain` namespace (issue #3), but `domain` is
//! *where a record lives*, not *how much it should be trusted*. An `agent_memory`
//! `Observation` may be an unverified guess, a guess backed by a passing
//! verification record, or one that has since been contradicted or superseded —
//! all three sit in the same domain. A cross-domain context answer deliberately
//! returns code facts, agent observations, and verification evidence side by
//! side, which is the one place that distinction can collapse: without a label
//! the cheapest path for a consuming agent is to treat every row as equally
//! true.
//!
//! [`TrustClass`] is that label. It is a **deterministic function of the
//! record's node kind plus its evidence and contradiction edges at the queried
//! snapshot** — no wall clock, no ranking, no numeric confidence (confidence
//! already lives on observations and is out of scope here).
//!
//! # Completeness invariant
//!
//! [`TrustIndex::classify`] matches every [`NodeKind`] variant with **no
//! wildcard arm**, mirroring the traversal-membership invariant in
//! [`super::evidence_path`]. A new node kind therefore fails to compile until it
//! is deliberately classified, so a future kind can never silently inherit a
//! truth-bearing label. Kinds with no derivation rule map to
//! [`TrustClass::Other`] — never to `source_derived` or `verification_evidence`.
//!
//! # What a label is not
//!
//! `verification_evidence` marks a *recorded verification execution*, never
//! proof of correctness. `agent_verified` states that the claim cites a live
//! passing verification record, never that the claim is true. `source_derived`
//! states that the record was derived deterministically from source, never that
//! it still matches the working tree (see `eg query context --repo-path` for
//! that).
