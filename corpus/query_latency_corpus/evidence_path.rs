//! Cross-domain evidence witness path (`eg query evidence-path`, issue #247).
//!
//! Answers ONE question — "is record A grounded in record B, and by what chain?"
//! — by tracing the shortest connecting path between two record handles over the
//! graph's cross-domain **evidence/provenance** edge subgraph and returning one
//! deterministic, redaction-safe witness path (or an explicit `no_path` verdict).
//!
//! This lane is a **read-time traversal** — it mints no edge and introduces no
//! new node kind, edge label, or trust class. It reads only the edges already in
//! the graph, partitioned into a TRAVERSED evidence set and an EXCLUDED
//! code-topology set by [`is_evidence_path_edge`], an exhaustive match over every
//! [`EdgeLabel`] variant (so a new variant forces a conscious classification
//! decision at compile time — the completeness invariant).
//!
//! Reachability is **undirected** over that subgraph: a grounding chain
//! legitimately mixes edge directions (an `OBSERVES` edge points memory→code
//! while a `VALIDATED_BY` edge points memory→evidence), so each edge is usable in
//! either direction. Every emitted hop reports the edge's NATIVE `from`/`to` as
//! stored plus a `traversal_direction` (`forward` when the walk moved along the
//! stored edge, `reverse` when against it). The path is the DETERMINISTIC shortest
//! path: fewest hops, then the lexicographically smallest path compared as the
//! full ordered sequence of `(neighbor_record_id, edge_record_id)` steps from the
//! source, so a difference at the first step dominates any later step.
//!
//! A witness path proves a live evidence-edge chain connects two records; it is
//! never proof the cited code still matches current source, and `EMITTED_DURING`
//! hops are correlation leads, never causation. Output is deterministic and
//! byte-identical across runs; no raw source/transcript/command/patch text ever
//! enters the envelope — only IDs, domains, kinds, edge labels, paths, spans,
//! counts, and basis strings.
