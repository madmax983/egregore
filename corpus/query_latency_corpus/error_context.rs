//! Cross-domain runtime-error context bundle (`eg query error-context`,
//! issue #324).
//!
//! Answers ONE question — "what does the graph know about this error signature?"
//! — by resolving an [`ErrorSignature`](crate::ir::NodeKind::ErrorSignature)
//! handle and assembling a single deterministic, trust-separated cross-domain
//! envelope: the signature identity plus its occurrence buckets and resolved
//! backtrace frames (`runtime_observation`), the code source facts its frames
//! name (`source_fact`), the agent runs/commands it was `EMITTED_DURING`
//! (`agent_observation` / `verification`), the tasks it `REFERENCES_TASK`
//! (`project_state`), a history `first_seen_range`, and — behind an opt-in
//! `--protected-store` — the protected raw-payload handles whose content hash
//! matches the signature's captured `LogSource`.
//!
//! This lane is a **read-time join** of three shipped cores — it mints no edge
//! and introduces no new node kind, edge label, or trust class:
//!
//! * [`record_context`](super::record_context) supplies the code half's
//!   trust-separated cross-domain bundle from each resolved frame target;
//! * the `link-logs` / `resolve-frames` log-edge topology (`CAPTURED_FROM`,
//!   `FRAME_RESOLVES_TO`, `AGGREGATES`, `EMITTED_DURING`, `REFERENCES_TASK`)
//!   supplies the runtime half;
//! * the issue #118 range mechanics ([`range_deltas`](super::range_deltas))
//!   supply the `first_seen_range` symbol-delta overlap.
//!
//! Every row is a CORRELATION LEAD, never proof of cause: a resolved frame
//! proves the backtrace NAMES a symbol, not that it is at fault; an
//! `EMITTED_DURING` edge is a content-hash or temporal correlation, never
//! causation. Output is deterministic and byte-identical across runs; no raw
//! log/transcript/command/patch text ever enters the envelope beyond the
//! signature's bounded, post-redaction `template_excerpt`.
