//! Deterministic repo-wide cross-file call resolution (issue #152).
//!
//! Per-file extraction only sees definitions in the file it is walking, so a
//! call from `src/b.rs` to a function defined in `src/a.rs` never produced a
//! `CALLS` edge. This module closes that recall gap with a resolution pass
//! that runs after every file has been extracted:
//!
//! 1. Each Rust file exports [`FileFacts`]: the callable definitions it
//!    contains and the syntactic call sites found inside recorded symbol
//!    bodies. Both come from the Tree-sitter AST — comments, string literals,
//!    and macro token trees can never produce a call site, so the pass adds
//!    zero comment/string/substring false positives (precision contract
//!    shared with issue #134).
//! 2. The pass builds a repo-wide index of callable definitions and resolves
//!    every call site against it, labeling each emitted `CALLS` edge with a
//!    [`CallResolution`] status:
//!    - `resolved` — exactly one in-repo candidate matched.
//!    - `ambiguous` — two or more candidates matched; an edge is emitted to
//!      every candidate.
//!    - `unresolved` — no in-repo candidate; the call is recorded against a
//!      deterministic `Diagnostic` node instead of being dropped or bound to
//!      an invented symbol.
//!
//! Resolution is purely syntactic and filesystem-local: simple-name matching
//! plus path-segment narrowing (`crate::`/`self::`/`super::` stripped,
//! `Self::` rewritten to the impl owner) and receiver kinds (`self.method()`
//! prefers the surrounding impl's methods). The documented boundary: in-repo
//! cross-file resolution yes; cross-crate targets, trait dynamic dispatch,
//! macro-expanded call sites, and generic monomorphization no. Method calls
//! with no in-repo candidate and constructor-style calls (leading-uppercase
//! final segment, e.g. `Some(..)`, `Vec::new()` receivers aside) are external
//! by construction and are not recorded as unresolved diagnostics to keep the
//! graph bounded; see `docs/prd/0001-codebase-knowledge-graph.md`.
//!
//! Output is deterministic: files iterate in sorted path order, call sites in
//! source order, candidates in sorted (path, qualified name, ID) order, and
//! duplicate (caller, target) pairs collapse to one edge preferring the
//! strongest status.
