///
/// v5: cached Rust `Symbol` records carry `visibility` / `signature` / `doc`
/// declaration-surface fields (issue #124); older caches rebuild so reused
/// records are never missing the new fields.
///
/// v6 adds per-file cross-file resolution facts and the previously emitted
/// cross-file record IDs (issue #152), and invalidates caches whose per-file
/// records still contain phantom comment/string-sourced reference edges
/// (issue #134); same-file resolution labels are recomputed per scan and are
/// never cached.
///
/// v7 adds per-file `PanicRiskSite` unwrap/expect call-site records
/// (issue #223); older caches rebuild so reused per-file records are never
/// missing the new sites.
///
/// v8: cached per-file records include `DebtMarker` debt-comment marker
/// nodes with their `note` field and `CONTAINS` edges (issue #218); older
/// caches rebuild so reused records are never missing the markers.
///
/// v9 adds per-file `UnsafeSite` records for `unsafe` blocks, `unsafe fn`
/// declarations, and `unsafe impl` blocks (issue #222); older caches rebuild
/// so reused per-file records are never missing the new sites.
///
/// v10 = #342 signature-only trait method Symbols: `function_signature_item`
/// declarations inside a trait body are now first-class `Symbol` records with
/// their `DEFINES` edges and `DefinitionFact`s; older caches rebuild so reused
/// per-file records are never missing the new symbols.
///
/// v11 deepens `IMPLEMENTS` extraction (issues #343, #344): same-file generic
/// trait impl headers now trait-edge-back (`impl<T> Trait for Type<T>` and
/// `impl GenP<u32> for Plain`), blanket impls (`impl<T> Trait for T`) are
/// bounded out, and inherent generic impls keep their self edge. #344 also
/// widens the serialized per-file `FileFacts` with `impl_targets` (exported
/// trait/type definitions) and `pending_impls` (locally-unresolved trait
/// impls) so the repo-wide pass can edge-back out-of-line cross-file impls;
/// older caches rebuild so reused per-file records carry both the new facts
/// and the new edges.
///
/// v12 adds the serde-default `shadowed_by_use` boolean to each per-file
/// `pending_impls` fact (issues #343/#344 round 9): the AST-derived
/// import-shadow verdict a bare trait/type impl carries into the repo-wide
/// cross-file pass, so a `use` (external/std or non-root local alias) that
/// shadows the bare name vetoes the wrong `IMPLEMENTS` edge. The field is
/// serde-default, but a bump forces older caches to rebuild so reused per-file
/// facts carry the verdict rather than defaulting it to `false`.
///
/// v15 adds the `content_signature` field to Node records: a Rust `Module` node
/// carries a compact BLAKE3 handle over its normalized body so a body change
/// with an unchanged name/path is content-detectable by evidence-freshness drift
/// (issue #206). (`Import` nodes intentionally do NOT carry it — an import's
/// stable ID already encodes its full `use ...;` declaration, so a body change
/// mints a new ID and surfaces as a handle-identity change, never a content
/// drift.) The field is serde-default, but an unchanged file served from an
/// older cache would lack it and hash inconsistently against freshly-rebuilt
/// neighbors, so the bump forces older caches to rebuild. (13/14 are reserved
/// for concurrent lanes; this lane takes 15.)
/// v13 adds crate-root partitioning of the cross-file `IMPLEMENTS` index
/// (issue #394: the serde-default `crate_root` on each `impl_targets` /
/// `pending_impls` fact) and import-aware bare-name resolution (issue #393: the
/// new `use_trait_imports` per-file vector capturing the resolved path each
/// module-item `use` binds). The fields are serde-default, but a bump forces
/// older caches to rebuild so reused per-file facts carry the crate root and
/// import paths rather than defaulting them, recovering the recall PR #389 left
/// conservatively unresolved.
///
/// v16 tracks the codegraph `SCHEMA_VERSION` 5→6 bump (issue #135, the
/// `ScanCoverage` node). Cached per-file records embed versioned record IDs
/// (e.g. a reused `File` and its `Repository —CONTAINS→ File` edge carry
/// `codegraph:v5:` IDs), so reusing a v5 cache after the bump would mint v6
/// repository/cross-file records that dangle against the reused v5 endpoints.
/// Bumping the cache version forces a full rebuild so every emitted record
/// shares the current `codegraph:v6:` identity. (This lane originally took 14;
/// renumbered to 16 after the v15 `content_signature` bump landed on trunk;
/// 16 -> 17 for the issue #390 `DefinitionFact.is_trait_method` field and the
/// trait-name-bearing `match_segments` shape, so per-file caches rebuild.
/// 17 -> 18 for the issue #414 `FileFacts.impl_trait_relations` vector AND the
/// issue #413 impl-side directness fix: a block-local `fn` nested inside an impl
/// method body is now a free function (`module::helper`), not `method`
/// (`Owner::helper`), so its cached symbol identity and edge set change and
/// per-file caches must rebuild rather than replay the mis-attributed records.)
/// 18 -> 19 for the issue #406 `ScanCoveragePayload.coverage_generation` field:
/// cached records embed serialized coverage shapes, so a bump forces older
/// caches to rebuild and re-emit the generation-bearing coverage node.
/// 19 -> 20 for the issue #440 qualified/cross-crate call-resolution fix: the
/// crate-relative `file_module_path`/`crate_root_id` derivation changes cached
/// `DefinitionFact.match_segments`/`crate_root` in workspace layouts, and the
/// new `CallSiteFact.path_root` field changes the cached call-site shape, so
/// per-file caches must rebuild rather than replay pre-#440 unresolved stubs.
/// (21 is reserved for issue #451.) 21 -> 22 for the issue #441
/// `CallSiteFact.receiver_type` field: a provable receiver type is now stamped
/// on non-`self` identifier method calls, changing the cached call-site shape,
/// so per-file caches must rebuild to narrow those calls instead of replaying
/// the pre-#441 ambiguous fan-out.
/// 22 -> 23 for the issue #438 non-UTF-8/unreadable source skip: such a file now
/// caches a `Diagnostic` (never a `File` node) and shifts the coverage counts,
/// so older caches must rebuild rather than replay the pre-skip record set.
/// 23 -> 24: #443 struct-literal CONSTRUCTS edges. The new
/// `FileFacts.construct_sites` field changes the cached per-file fact shape, so
/// per-file caches must rebuild to emit the CONSTRUCTS edges instead of
/// replaying pre-#443 facts that carried none.
/// 24 -> 25: #445 route-registration facts. The new
/// `FileFacts.route_registration_sites` field and the route attributes captured
/// on Symbol facts change the cached per-file fact shape, so per-file caches
/// must rebuild to emit the `REGISTERS_ROUTE` edges and route annotations instead
/// of replaying pre-#445 facts that carried none.
/// 25 -> 26: #117 owning-Cargo-package attribution. The paired codegraph
/// `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump 8 -> 9 changes every `codegraph:v<N>:` record ID
/// prefix, so a cache holding v8 IDs would replay records whose endpoints no
/// longer match freshly-minted v9 ones. Attribution itself is deliberately NOT
/// cached: it is recomputed on every refresh, so a source file byte-identical
/// to its cached version whose owning `Cargo.toml` was added, renamed, or

/// Independent of this version, the cache records the writing binary's
