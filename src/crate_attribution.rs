//! Owning-Cargo-package attribution for code-graph facts (issue #117).
//!
//! # SPEC
//!
//! Egregore scans a repository as a flat pool of source files: every code fact
//! carries a `repo_relative_path`, but nothing records *which Cargo package
//! owns it*. In a workspace monorepo that makes the natural subsystem boundary
//! of a Rust project — the Cargo package — the one boundary the graph cannot
//! express, forcing agents back onto path-prefix guessing (#83) that conflates
//! a directory with a package and cannot name it.
//!
//! This module is the **pure** resolver behind that attribution. It takes a set
//! of [`ManifestPackageFact`]s — one per `Cargo.toml` discovered in a tree —
//! and answers, for any repo-relative path, which package owns it.
//!
//! ## The rule
//!
//! **Nearest enclosing manifest wins.** The walk visits ancestor directories of
//! the queried path from its own directory outwards to the repository root, and
//! resolves at the first ancestor holding a manifest fact:
//!
//! | Fact at ancestor      | Result                              | Walk       |
//! |-----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
//! | a usable package name | attributed to it                    | **stop**   |
//! | `[package]`, no usable name | `unnamed_package`             | **stop**   |
//! | TOML parse failure    | `unparseable_manifest`              | **stop**   |
//! | no `[package]` and no `[workspace]` | `unusable_manifest`   | **stop**   |
//! | unreadable / non-UTF-8 | `manifest_unreadable`              | **stop**   |
//! | virtual (`[workspace]`, no `[package]`) | —                 | *continue* |
//! | none                  | —                                   | *continue* |
//!
//! A virtual manifest declares no package and cannot own a file, so the walk
//! passes it and keeps looking outwards — matching Cargo. Every other manifest
//! form **stops** the walk: inheriting an ancestor's name across an unreadable
//! or nameless boundary would fabricate a package attribution, which the issue
//! forbids outright.
//!
//! Reaching the root with no stop yields [`CrateAttributionReason::VirtualManifestOnly`]
//! when at least one virtual manifest was walked past, and
//! [`CrateAttributionReason::NoEnclosingManifest`] otherwise.
//!
//! ## Purity
//!
//! This module performs **no I/O**: no filesystem access, no process spawning,
//! no clock. Its only inputs are already-harvested facts and `&str` paths.
//! That is what lets the current-tree scan (which reads manifests from the
//! working tree) and history replay (which reads them from Git objects) share
//! one implementation and provably agree — the two harvest sites differ, the
//! rule does not.
//!
//! ## Epistemic limit
//!
//! Attribution is nearest-enclosing-manifest directory containment, never proof
//! the file is compiled into that package.

/// The rule is PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT by design. On Windows `normalize_path`
/// treats `\` as a separator and emits `/`, so a Windows producer cannot write
/// a literal backslash — but a graph is portable data, and a store scanned on
/// Linux is a legitimate input to a query running on Windows. The test is
