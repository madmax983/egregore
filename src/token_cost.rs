//! Query-answer token-cost measurement against the ripgrep baseline (issue #84).
//!
//! This module is a **measurement layer** over the existing `eg query symbol`,
//! `eg query file`, and `eg query semantic` answer shapes. For a fixed question
//! set over a pinned representative Rust corpus it measures, per question and in
//! aggregate, the token cost of the returned Egregore answer versus the
//! grep-shaped baseline an agent would otherwise have to ingest to answer the
//! same question. It introduces **no** new graph domain, node kind, edge label,
//! query semantics, importer, or output-schema change.
//!
//! The core ([`run_token_cost_report`]) is pure and deterministic: it never
//! prints, never exits, performs no I/O, executes no subprocess, and emits
//! canonically-ordered output so the same corpus + records yield byte-identical
//! token counts, ratios, and ordering across runs (AC8). The grep baseline is
//! computed in-process with a documented, pinned line-matching rule and the
//! equivalent `rg` command is recorded for each question (AC2/AC10); the gate
//! never shells out, so it does not depend on ripgrep being installed.
//!
//! Token counting uses a single pinned heuristic, [`count_tokens`]
//! (`word-punct-v1`), applied identically to both the Egregore answer and the
//! baseline so the ratio is reproducible (AC3).
