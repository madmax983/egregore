// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Indexes, per record ID, the position of the `symbol_name` record that is part
/// of the snapshot at `instant`.
///
/// Two steps, and BOTH are needed before a package filter may run:
///
/// 1. Each IDENTITY collapses to its newest `valid_time` at or before the
///    instant. This mirrors `query::symbol_as_of_valid_time_by_repo`'s own rule
///    (strictly-greater wins, so an exact tie keeps the earlier position)
///    restricted to one identity, so it can never disagree with the winner that
///    function would pick. It is what makes a manifest RENAME correct: the ID is
///    stable, so there is one identity, and its current version carries the new
///    package.
/// 2. Identities absent from the snapshot are DROPPED. A file MOVE changes the
///    stable ID (the path is part of the ADR-0004 preimage), so the old and new
///    locations are distinct identities; step 1 alone would keep the old one's
///    final version alive forever, and a package filter that removes the current
///    row would then let that stale row win — answering from a file that no
///    longer exists. History replay re-emits every live record at every commit,
///    so an identity present in the snapshot carries that snapshot's
///    `valid_time`; one whose newest version is older was not there.
///
/// The snapshot instant is computed PER REPOSITORY, grouped exactly as
/// `symbol_as_of_valid_time_by_repo` groups (including the shared unattributed
/// group), so one repository's commit timeline never evicts another's current
/// records.
///
/// Deletion semantics are deliberately unchanged: a symbol removed outright
/// still resolves to its last recorded version, exactly as the unscoped lane
/// resolves it. This function only makes the SCOPED answer agree with the
/// snapshot the unscoped lane would already have chosen.
