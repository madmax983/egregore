//! One-command repository bootstrap: clone to queryable embedded store (issue #229).
//!
//! `eg init <repo> --data-dir <dir>` orchestrates the existing capture verbs
//! in-process — current-tree scan, embedded ingest with semantic embeddings
//! (generated for the tree batch, on by default), Git history replay, and
//! structural history ingest — into a single embedded store, then
//! prints a machine-readable bootstrap report. It never shells out to a second
//! `eg` binary: it calls the same lane functions the individual commands use
//! ([`scan`], [`scan_history`], and the embedded ingest pipeline from
//! [`ingest`]), so the store it builds cannot drift from the documented
//! multi-step sequence.
//!
//! Exit codes (documented in `docs/cli/init.md`):
//! - `0` — the store was built or rebuilt and is queryable. The report's
//!   `status` distinguishes `rebuilt` (every attempted stage completed) from
//!   `partial` (an optional stage was skipped or failed but the store is still
//!   usable); the report names every stage either way.
//! - `3` ([`INIT_ALREADY_CURRENT_EXIT_CODE`]) — already current: the recorded
//!   source snapshot matches the working tree and the requested semantic state
//!   is present, so nothing was rebuilt.
//! - `1` — a required stage failed. The report is printed first and names the
//!   completed and failed stages; the store is left in the documented
//!   non-corrupt state (whatever the completed stages wrote, exactly as the
//!   manual sequence would leave it).
//! - `2` ([`INIT_REFUSED_EXIT_CODE`]) — refused before writing anything (the
//!   capacity preflight or the embedding-index identity conflict). The store is
//!   untouched.
//!
//! History replay reads Git objects read-only — the `scan-history` lane's
//! contract, preserved here — so the working tree and Git state are never
//! mutated. Intermediate JSONL lives in a system temporary directory, never
//! in the repository being bootstrapped.
