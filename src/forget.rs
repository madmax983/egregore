//! Operator-facing logical retraction of a persisted record (issue #231).
//!
//! `eg forget <handle>` retracts one record — identified by its stable record
//! ID — from every transaction-time-current read surface, without destroying
//! the bytes. Retraction writes two records through the ordinary adapter
//! boundary:
//!
//! 1. A domain-scoped [`GraphRecord::Tombstone`] whose `deleted_id` is the
//!    target. Every current-state read lane (structural queries, semantic /
//!    vector search, context, task, memory, audit, failures, changes, MCP
//!    tools) already excludes actively tombstoned records, so the exclusion is
//!    enforced by the same machinery the deterministic refresh path uses.
//! 2. A citable [`NodeKind::Retraction`] event node in the agent-memory domain
//!    recording who retracted the target (`agent_id`), when on the
//!    transaction-time axis (`transaction_time`), why (`text`, passed through
//!    redaction policy v1), and the prior record handle (`source_handle`).
//!
//! Retraction is refused for deterministic code-graph facts (`codegraph:`
//! domain: File / Symbol / Import / CALLS edges / Commit / Change and every
//! other scan-derived record); those are reproducible from source and must be
//! corrected with `eg refresh` or a re-scan. Derived semantic measurements
//! (`semantic:` domain: `SemanticDrift` and its `DRIFTS_*` edges) are refused
//! for the same reason — they are re-derived deterministically from history
//! with a pinned embedding model and threshold, and as temporal records a
//! tombstone would not actually suppress them from the current-state read.
//! Any other commit-anchored (temporal) node — e.g. a manually ingested
//! observation carrying temporal metadata — is refused for that same
//! mechanical reason (`temporal_record`); commit-anchored *edges* stay
//! retractable because evidence-link edges legitimately carry routing-only
//! commit anchors and the edge read path honors tombstones. It is also
//! refused for tombstones and for retraction events themselves — forgetting
//! the audit trail would turn retraction back into a silent hole.
//!
//! Retraction is logical and bi-temporally honest: the physical record stays
//! in the store, so a transaction-time view predating the retraction still
//! reflects that the record existed then. Re-running `eg forget` on an
//! already-retracted handle is a no-op success returning the original event —
//! but only after verifying the target is still suppressed by an active
//! tombstone. When the event exists without the tombstone (a crash between
//! the two writes, or a later write superseding the tombstone), the re-run
//! repairs the retraction by re-issuing the tombstone instead of falsely
//! reporting the retraction complete.
