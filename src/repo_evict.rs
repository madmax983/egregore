//! Whole-repository logical eviction (issue #248).
//!
//! `eg forget-repo <selector>` logically evicts EVERY record belonging to ONE
//! repository from a shared multi-repo embedded store, across every domain
//! (code facts, semantic drift, agent memory, project/task, artifact,
//! verification, log), leaving co-resident repositories byte-identical.
//!
//! This is the SANCTIONED BULK EXCEPTION to issue #231's rule that deterministic
//! code facts are never tombstoned: the unit forgotten is the whole repository,
//! not a single fact being corrected. Eviction is *logical* — one
//! [`GraphRecord::Tombstone`] per attributed record (INCLUDING the repository
//! identity node itself, so the evicted repo disappears from the catalog surface,
//! not just its contents) plus exactly ONE auditable eviction event (a reused
//! [`NodeKind::Retraction`] node whose prior handle is the repository identity) —
//! so the bytes stay in the store for bi-temporal history views while every
//! current-state read/serving lane drops the repo. Provenance survives in the
//! eviction event, which references the evicted identity as a string handle.
//!
//! # Scan-history temporal residual
//!
//! On a NON-temporal (`eg scan`) store a base-ID tombstone fully suppresses every
//! evicted record from every current-state read. On a `scan-history` (temporal)
//! store the shared `read_all_records` re-emits every commit-anchored code
//! snapshot with NO tombstone check — the same read path that serves issue #231
//! `forget`'s deliberate `--at`-after-deletion bi-temporal honesty — so a base-ID
//! tombstone CANNOT suppress commit-anchored code snapshots from the HEAD-anchored
//! current-state code lanes. The plan therefore discloses those still-visible
//! snapshots under `temporal_snapshots_retained` (empty on a non-temporal store)
//! rather than silently leaking them. See `docs/cli/forget-repo.md`.
//!
//! # Cross-domain attribution
//!
//! 1. **Seed** the owned set from [`RepositoryIndex`]: code-graph containment
//!    (`owner_of`), `SemanticDrift` (via `DRIFTS_FROM`), and log records (the
//!    `repository_id` payload field, issue #362).
//! 2. **Extend** by walking the cross-domain *evidence* subgraph (an exhaustive
//!    partition of [`EdgeLabel`], mirroring the #247 evidence-path set) undirected
//!    from the seed. A non-seed record reached from exactly ONE repository is
//!    attributed to it; a record reached from TWO OR MORE repositories is SHARED
//!    and is NEVER evicted (reported under `shared_cross_repo`).
//! 3. **Honest-gap**: a record with no derivable attribution (a legacy log with
//!    an empty `repository_id`, an orphan artifact) is REPORTED under
//!    `unattributable` and NEVER evicted. Attribution is never guessed.
//! 4. **Cross-repo citation**: a SURVIVING record that merely cites an evicted
//!    handle over an evidence edge is KEPT; the now-dangling link is REPORTED
//!    under `cross_repo_citations`, never silently dropped or cascade-evicted.
//!
//! The pure core here is deterministic: a pinned `transaction_time` yields a
//! byte-identical plan and envelope across runs.
