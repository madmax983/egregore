# Egregore: Code Graph + Semantic Search

Egregore extracts a deterministic knowledge graph from a Rust codebase, stores it in an embedded AletheiaDB store, and exposes structural and semantic queries. It replaces grepping with typed graph edges (DEFINES, CALLS, IMPORTS, MENTIONS) and natural-language vector search — reducing agent context cost by 10–15× versus raw text search.

The primary binary is `egregore`; `eg` is the short alias.

## Setup Workflow

Three commands from zero to queryable. Run them once per repo (or on each significant change).

### Step 1 — Scan

```powershell
egregore scan . --out graph.jsonl
egregore inspect graph.jsonl   # verify: nodes, edges, diagnostics counts
```

Parses every `.rs` file with Tree-sitter. Produces a stable JSONL graph of files, modules, symbols, imports, diagnostics, and their relationships. Does not modify the working checkout.

For history (drift detection, point-in-time queries):

```powershell
egregore scan-history . --out history.graph.jsonl
```

### Step 2 — Ingest (structural)

```powershell
egregore ingest graph.jsonl --adapter embedded --data-dir .egregore
```

Writes the graph into a local AletheiaDB store. No server required.

### Step 3 — Ingest with embeddings (semantic)

**First time on a new machine** — prime the model cache via Python (Rust's TLS stack may not trust the OS cert store on Windows):

```powershell
pip install -U sentence-transformers
python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"
```

Then ingest with embeddings:

```powershell
egregore ingest graph.jsonl --adapter embedded --data-dir .egregore-semantic --embed
```

`--embed` generates a 384-dim dense vector for every file and symbol node and stores it in an HNSW index. Use a separate `--data-dir` so the fast structural store stays lean.

## Querying

### Structural queries

Exact-match, no embedding model needed. Works against either JSONL or an ingested store.

```powershell
# Where is this symbol defined?
egregore query symbol daemon::handle_query --data-dir .egregore --format text

# What symbols does this file define?
egregore query file src/daemon.rs --data-dir .egregore --format text

# Which symbols changed the most semantically across commits?
egregore query drift --data-dir .egregore --limit 10 --format text

# What did this symbol look like at a specific commit?
egregore query symbol daemon::handle_query --data-dir .egregore --at <sha>

# Query directly from JSONL (no store required)
egregore query symbol scan_repository --graph graph.jsonl
```

### Semantic queries

Natural language. Requires a store ingested with `--embed`.

```powershell
egregore query semantic "error handling and budget limits" \
    --data-dir .egregore-semantic --format text

egregore query semantic "write nodes to database storage" \
    --data-dir .egregore-semantic --format text --limit 5
```

Results are ranked by cosine similarity. The model finds code by **concept**, not by name — `"write nodes to database storage"` surfaces `EmbeddedAletheiaSink::write_record` even though those words don't appear in the function name.

## Output Format

All queries emit newline-delimited JSON by default (machine-readable, agent-friendly). Add `--format text` for human-readable one-line-per-result output.

Example text output:
```
daemon::handle_query (Symbol) @ src/daemon.rs:1383
daemon::check_query_budget score=0.2522 @ src/daemon.rs:1469
```

## Choosing the Right Query

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Find where a symbol is defined | `query symbol <fully::qualified::name>` |
| See all symbols in a file | `query file <path>` |
| Find code by concept or description | `query semantic "<description>"` |
| See what changed most between commits | `query drift` |
| Pin a query to a specific commit | Add `--at <sha>` to any structural query |

**Structural queries** are best when you know the name. Use fully-qualified Rust paths (`module::Type::method`), not just the short name.

**Semantic queries** are best when you know the concept but not the name, or when you're exploring an unfamiliar codebase. Phrase queries as descriptions of what the code *does*, not what it *is*.

## Interpreting Results

- **score** on semantic results: cosine similarity (higher = more similar). Scores above ~0.35 are typically strong matches; 0.10–0.20 are thematically related.
- **span** (`start_line`): exact source location. Use `query symbol` with `--format json` to get machine-readable line numbers for follow-up reads.
- **record_id**: stable content-addressed ID. Use this to correlate records across runs or with the raw JSONL.

## Typical Agent Workflow

When starting work on an unfamiliar codebase or planning a refactor:

1. **Scan and ingest** once (keep `.egregore/` and `.egregore-semantic/` out of git).
2. **Semantic search** to orient: `"how is authentication handled"`, `"where is the retry logic"`.
3. **Structural queries** to zoom in: `query symbol` on the top hits, `query file` to see what else lives there.
4. **Impact analysis** before changing anything: search for callers of the target symbol in the JSONL edges (see `references/query-patterns.md`).
5. **Drift check** after a batch of commits to spot unexpected semantic changes.

For detailed patterns — impact analysis, refactoring safety checks, cross-commit comparison, architecture exploration — see `references/query-patterns.md`.

## Protected Raw-Artifact Capture (issue #60)

When evidence sources (transcripts, command output, patches, task narratives, reports) may be
deleted or moved after the fact, use `eg protected` to retain the raw bytes in a local
content-addressed store that the graph, query, and semantic surfaces never read.

```powershell
# Preview only (disabled) — compute hashes and handles, write nothing
egregore protected capture --manifest evidence.jsonl --store .egregore/protected

# Enable capture — store blobs, register operator
egregore protected capture \
  --manifest evidence.jsonl \
  --store .egregore/protected \
  --protected-raw-artifacts \
  --producer "op-alice"

# Retrieve by handle after sources are gone (BLAKE3 hash verified)
egregore protected get protected:v1:<hex> \
  --store .egregore/protected \
  --operator "op-alice" \
  --out retrieved.txt

# List metadata (no raw bytes)
egregore protected list --store .egregore/protected
```

Supported classes: `transcript`, `command_output`, `patch`, `task_narrative`, `report`.
