# Git History and Scan Safety Guarantees

Egregore guarantees that scanning operations (`eg scan` and `eg scan-history`) are strictly read-only and safe to run on active, dirty working trees. They will never mutate the repository's Git state or modify any files in the working directory, with the sole exception of writing the requested `--out` file.

## Guarantees

- **No checkout mutations**: History replay reads Git tree objects directly via plumbing commands (e.g. `git show <sha>:<path>`, `git ls-tree`, `git diff-tree`). It does not use checkout/reset/stash workflows to materialize versions, meaning it never touches your active checkout.
- **Index protection**: All git commands executed during scanning run with `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, which prevents Git from writing or refreshing the index file, avoiding lock-file contention and index updates.
- **Detached HEAD compatibility**: Both commands are fully compatible with detached HEAD states, staged changes, unstaged edits, untracked files, and stashed work. 
- **Deterministic Committed History**: Running `eg scan-history` on a repository with uncommitted work yields the exact same committed history graph output as running it on a clean tree at the same commit.

## Covered Commands

- `eg scan <repo_path> --out <file>`
- `eg scan-history <repo_path> --out <file>`

Both commands are fully offline and run with no network access.

### History windows (issue #256)

The `scan-history` window flags (`--max-commits`, `--since`, `--from` /
`--to`) use the same read-only plumbing — `git rev-list`, `git rev-parse`,
and the tree-object reads above — so the no-mutation guarantee extends to
windowed replays unchanged. A windowed replay additionally records its
resolved window as a `HistoryReplayWindow` node (see
`docs/cli/scan-history.md`) so a bounded-history graph can never be mistaken
for a full-history one.

## Out of Scope

- **Output File Writes**: The command will write the final serialized JSONL graph to the path supplied in the `--out` flag, creating or overwriting that file. If the path specified by `--out` lives inside the repository directory, it will modify that file in the working tree. For a completely mutation-free run, specify an `--out` file path located outside the repository root.
- **Ingestion and Query paths**: Commands like `eg ingest` and `eg query` are out of scope for these git repo guarantees. They write metadata, indexes, and nodes to an explicitly supplied `--data-dir` external to the tracked Git state.
- **Incremental Cache**: `eg refresh` reads working-tree edits as input and caches results under `--data-dir`, but does not mutate the git repository itself.
