# Upgrading an embedded store to `AletheiaDB` 0.2.0

Egregore's embedded store (`--data-dir`) is an `AletheiaDB` data directory.
Egregore now links `AletheiaDB` **0.2.0**, up from 0.1.1. This page is for
operators who have an existing `.egregore` directory written by an older `eg`
build.

**Short version:** if your old `eg` process exited cleanly, there is nothing to
do. Every `eg` command that opens a store writes its indexes and shuts the store
down through the normal drop path, so a directory left behind by a completed
command opens under 0.2.0 with full integrity. The one failure mode below is
reachable only when a writer was killed mid-run.

## The one refusal you can hit

`AletheiaDB` 0.2.0 **refuses to open** a data directory that still holds an
unreplayed **pre-v13 write-ahead-log tail** — the shape left behind when an
`eg` build linked against 0.1.x was hard-killed (SIGKILL, container OOM, power
loss) before it drained its WAL.

This is a refusal, not corruption, and it is deliberately fail-closed. 0.1.x
wrote WAL labels as *process-local string-interner ids* rather than as strings.
0.2.0 rebuilds its interner in a different order, so replaying such a tail would
resolve those ids to unrelated strings — silently mislabelling every record
recovered from the tail, with no way to recover the original (the string was
never on disk). Upstream refuses rather than corrupt. **The failed open modifies
nothing**; the directory is exactly as it was.

Egregore surfaces this as an open failure naming the data directory, stating
that nothing was modified, and carrying the remedy plus the upstream detail.

### Remedy

1. **Re-open the directory once with the previous `eg` build.** It drains its
   own WAL and shuts down cleanly. Then re-run under the current build. This is
   the lossless path and the one to prefer.
2. **If the old build is unavailable**, re-ingest from JSONL into a **fresh**
   `--data-dir`. Note that `eg export` reads through the same refused open, so
   exporting the stranded store also requires the old build — recover the JSONL
   from wherever `eg scan` wrote it, not from the store.

There is no in-place repair, and no backup/restore off-ramp: `AletheiaDB`'s
`.albk` backup format did not exist in 0.1.x, so a 0.1.x-era store cannot be
backed up on the old version and restored on the new one. In-place open of a
drained directory is the only migration path.

Going forward this cannot recur: 0.2.0 writes WAL segments that carry labels as
strings, so a hard-killed 0.2.0 writer replays correctly.

## String-interner headroom

The other operator-visible change is a **100× relaxation**. 0.1.1 capped its
process-global string interner at a hardcoded 100 000 entries; 0.2.0 makes it
configurable and Egregore sets it explicitly to **10 000 000**. Graphs that
0.1.1 refused to ingest outright now ingest normally. 0.2.0 also removed the
background-persistence retry loop that turned an overflow into a hang.

Full contract — the preflight estimate, `--force`, and the exit-2 capacity
class — is in [`ingest.md`](ingest.md#capacity-preflight-and-fatal-capacity-classification-issue-439).

## Vector indexes now fail quietly — and Egregore makes that loud again

0.2.0 loads per-property vector indexes in parallel **with error isolation**: a
corrupted or unreadable one is skipped with a warning instead of aborting the
load of every remaining index. 0.1.1 would have failed the open outright, so an
operator with a damaged semantic index used to find out immediately.

A skipped index is absent from the engine's index list, which is exactly how a
never-embedded store looks — so without help, `eg query semantic` would have
reported `semantic_index_absent` ("re-run ingest with `--embed`") about a store
whose embeddings exist and are **corrupt**. Egregore therefore probes the
store's persisted index directory when the engine reports no index, and reports
the two states apart:

* `semantic_index_unreadable` (exit `11`) — the index files are on disk and the
  engine skipped them.
* `semantic_index_absent` (exit `2`) — genuinely never embedded. Unchanged.

`eg inspect --data-dir` carries the same three-way state as
`semantic_index.index_status` (`loaded` / `unreadable` / `absent`), and
`eg ingest --embed` **refuses** a store in the unreadable state rather than
enabling an index over the skipped files — upstream documents that doing so
creates an empty index whose next persistence cycle overwrites them,
permanently losing the indexed vectors. The remedy is a fresh `--data-dir`;
Egregore performs no automatic repair. Full contract in
[`semantic-index-identity.md`](semantic-index-identity.md#a-corrupt-index-is-not-an-absent-one-issue-489).

## What did not change

Record IDs, schema versions, the JSONL contract, query output, and determinism
are all unaffected: this is a storage-substrate upgrade, not a schema change. A
graph exported before the upgrade re-ingests byte-identically after it.
`AletheiaDB` 0.2.0's new opt-in subsystems (namespaces, property indexes,
changefeed, encryption, replication, multi-tenancy) are inert — Egregore does not
enable any of them.

**Schema constraints** are the one exception, and they are still off by default:
no Egregore write path declares them, so an untouched store is fully schemaless
exactly as before. An operator can opt in with
[`eg audit schema-constraints --declare`](schema-constraints.md), and `--drop`
retracts it.

## Upgrading a store across a codegraph `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump

Separate from the `AletheiaDB` substrate upgrade above: when Egregore's own
codegraph `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumps (most recently `8 → 9` for issue #117's
owning-package attribution), **every `codegraph:v<N>:` record ID prefix
changes**. `stable_id` formats the version into the ID, so the same symbol in
the same file mints a different ID before and after the bump.

That has one operator-visible consequence:

- **Re-ingesting a v9 graph into a store that already holds v8 records adds
  them alongside, it does not supersede them.** Supersession keys on record ID,
  and the IDs differ, so the store ends up carrying two live generations of the
  same facts. `eg inspect --data-dir` will show both under
  `schema_version codegraph <Kind> v8` and `… v9`.

- **There is no in-place migration.** The remedy is a **fresh `--data-dir`**:

  ```powershell
  eg scan . --out graph.jsonl
  eg ingest graph.jsonl --adapter embedded --data-dir .egregore-v9
  ```

  Re-extraction from source regenerates every code-graph record deterministically
  under the current version, so nothing is lost that a re-scan cannot rebuild.
  Agent-memory, verification, project, artifact, and log records are versioned
  per-domain and are **not** affected by a codegraph bump; `eg export` from the
  old store and re-ingest into the new one carries them across.

- **The incremental cache invalidates itself.** `CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumps in
  lockstep, so the next `eg refresh` rebuilds from source rather than replaying
  cached records that carry stale-prefix IDs.

- **`eg query producer-drift` will report drift** for every pre-bump record in an
  existing store, since the producer signature changed. Drift never changes the
  command's exit code — it is a report of what re-extraction would change.

The reader gate is a **range** (`1..=SCHEMA_VERSION`), so an older codegraph
record is still readable after a bump; it is not rejected with
`unknown_schema_version`. The duplication above is the cost of mixing
generations, not a read failure.
