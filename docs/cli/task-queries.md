# eg query task

Retrieve evidence-backed context for a task starting from a task ID or source handle.

## Synopsis

```text
eg query task <ID_OR_HANDLE> --graph <PATH>
eg query task <ID_OR_HANDLE> --data-dir <DIR> [--daemon]
```

This command accepts either:
- `--graph <PATH>` — read from a JSONL file.
- `--data-dir <DIR>` — read from an embedded AletheiaDB store.

Additionally, when using `--data-dir`, you can specify `--daemon` to query through a running local Egregore daemon.

## Handle Resolution

The `<ID_OR_HANDLE>` argument can be in any of the following supported formats:

1. **Canonical ID**: e.g., `project:v1:72c88f...` (prefix `project:` followed by `v` + version + 64-hex SHA)
2. **GitHub Issue/PR URL**: e.g., `https://github.com/madmax983/egregore/issues/48`
3. **GitHub Issue/PR Short Handle**: e.g., `madmax983/egregore#48`
4. **Local JSONL task handle**: e.g., `path/to/tasks.jsonl:1`

If the handle resolves to multiple distinct task IDs in the database, the command fails with stable exit code `1` and prints an `Ambiguous` JSON error.

If the handle format is unrecognized, the command fails with stable exit code `1` and prints an `Unsupported` JSON error.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success. Structured JSON printed to stdout. |
| `1` | Unsupported or Ambiguous handle format. Diagnostic JSON printed to stderr. |
| `2` | Task not found / no match. Standard no_match envelope printed to stdout. |

## JSON Output Structure

The output is a structured JSON envelope containing 9 context sections, sorted deterministically by stable ID:

* **`tasks`**: The queried `Task` node(s), including historical versions.
* **`acceptance_criteria`**: `AcceptanceCriterion` nodes owned by the Task. Verified acceptance criteria (status `verified`) will carry/inline their closing verification record under the `verification_record` field.
* **`source_facts`**: Code-graph files or symbols linked to the task.
* **`observations`**: Subjective agent-authored claims and failure records referencing the task. Holds `Observation` and `Failure` records only — never `Decision` records.
* **`decisions`**: Agent-authored `Decision` nodes referencing the task, each carrying `decision_text` and `rationale_summary` plus `record_id`, `confidence` (when present), a provenance handle, and resolved `EXPLAINS_CHANGE` / `REFERENCES_TASK` evidence handles. Trust contract: decisions are agent-authored and evidence-backed, but they are deliberate judgments — never deterministic source truth. Treat the rationale as a claim to verify before reusing, not a fact to cite.
* **`artifacts`**: `Artifact`, `PatchArtifact`, or `FileEdit` nodes linked to the task.
* **`verification_evidence`**: `Verification` or `CommandRun` nodes validating the task or closing its criteria.
* **`external_links`**: `ExternalLink` nodes referencing source issues.
* **`unresolved`**: Missing evidence link targets.

## Store-wide counterpart

These lanes answer for **one task you already named**. For the store-wide
acceptance-criterion proof-gap census — which criteria across all imported work
are actually closed by passing evidence, and which tasks are marked done while
owning unproven criteria — see
[`docs/cli/criteria-coverage.md`](criteria-coverage.md). It is the report that
tells you *which* tasks are worth drilling into here.
