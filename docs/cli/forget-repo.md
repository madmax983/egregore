# eg forget-repo

`eg forget-repo <selector>` logically evicts EVERY record belonging to ONE
repository from a shared multi-repo embedded store, across every domain — code
facts, semantic drift, agent memory, project/task, artifact, verification, and
log — leaving co-resident repositories byte-identical (issue #248).

This is the **sanctioned bulk exception** to issue #231's rule that deterministic
code facts are never tombstoned. `eg forget` corrects a single wrong or sensitive
fact and REFUSES code-graph, semantic, and temporal records; `eg forget-repo`
offboards a whole repository as a unit. Eviction is **not** record-level
tombstoning of individual facts: it is a repository-scoped operation whose
audit trail is one event, not one decision per fact.

Eviction is **logical**, exactly like `eg forget`: the bytes stay in the store
for bi-temporal history views, while every current-state read/serving lane drops
the repository. There is no physical delete (the `aletheiadb` API exposes none).

## Synopsis

```powershell
# Dry-run is the DEFAULT: read-only, prints the eviction plan, mutates nothing.
eg forget-repo acme/widget --data-dir .egregore --reason "offboarded customer"

# Perform the eviction.
eg forget-repo acme/widget --data-dir .egregore --reason "offboarded customer" --confirm

# Re-running is an idempotent no-op success (action: already_evicted).
eg forget-repo acme/widget --data-dir .egregore --reason "anything" --confirm

# Any identity handle resolves the repository.
eg forget-repo https://example.com/acme/widget --data-dir .egregore --reason "x" --confirm
eg forget-repo codegraph:v6:<hex> --data-dir .egregore --reason "x" --confirm

# Unknown / ambiguous selectors exit 2.
eg forget-repo no-such-repo --data-dir .egregore --reason "x"   # unknown_repository_selector
eg forget-repo widget --data-dir .egregore --reason "x"         # ambiguous_repository_selector
```

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<selector>` | Repository selector: record ID, `owner/name`, basename, remote URL, root commit SHA, or canonical path (reuses `RepositoryIndex::resolve_selector`). |
| `--data-dir` | Embedded `AletheiaDB` data directory (default `.egregore`). |
| `--reason` | Required eviction reason, recorded on the event (redaction policy v1 applies). |
| `--evicted-by` | Operator handle recorded as the actor (default `operator`). |
| `--transaction-time` | Fixed RFC 3339 instant for deterministic output; defaults to now. |
| `--confirm` | Perform the eviction. **Dry-run is the default** — without this flag the command is strictly read-only, takes no write lease, and mutates nothing. |

`--confirm` needs exclusive store access (the ordinary embedded write lease); a
running daemon holding the lease is refused with `store_contended`. Dry-run reads
a throwaway snapshot copy and never takes the lease.

## Exit codes

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| 0 | Dry-run plan; successful eviction; idempotent no-op (`already_evicted`); repair of a partial prior eviction (`repaired`). |
| 1 | Malformed request field: empty `--reason` (`missing_reason`), empty `--evicted-by` (`missing_evicted_by`), invalid `--transaction-time` (`invalid_transaction_time`). |
| 2 | `unknown_repository_selector` (no repository matches) / `ambiguous_repository_selector` (more than one matches; candidates listed). |

The error envelope is printed to stderr as the last non-empty line:
`{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"...","detail":{...}}}`. For an ambiguous selector,
`detail.candidates` lists every matching repository record ID (sorted).

## Success envelope (stdout, one JSON line)

```json
{"ok":true,"action":"dry_run",
 "repository":{"id":"codegraph:v6:...","display":"acme/widget"},
 "evicted_by":"op-1","reason":"offboarded customer","transaction_time":"...",
 "planned":{"total":15,
   "by_domain":{"agent_memory":2,"artifact":2,"codegraph":4,"log":1,
     "project":2,"semantic":2,"verification":2},
   "representative_ids":["..."]},
 "unattributable":{"total":0,"by_domain":{},"representative_ids":[]},
 "shared_cross_repo":{"total":0,"representative_ids":[]},
 "temporal_snapshots_retained":{"total":0,"representative_ids":[]},
 "cross_repo_citations":[]}
```

`temporal_snapshots_retained` is present in **both** dry-run and `--confirm`
output. It enumerates (count + representative IDs) the evicted CODE records that
carry commit/temporal metadata — the records eviction tombstones but that a
`scan-history` store's shared read path still surfaces on current-state code
lanes (see [Temporal-store residual](#temporal-store-residual-scan-history)). It
is empty on a non-temporal (`eg scan`) store.

`--confirm` sets `"action":"evicted"` and adds
`"eviction":{"event_id":"agent_memory:v1:...","tombstone_count":N}`. A re-run
sets `"action":"already_evicted"` when the prior eviction still suppresses the
repository, or `"action":"repaired"` when it re-issues tombstones for records that
are live again (see [Verify-and-repair](#verify-and-repair-mirrors-231-eg-forget));
a dry-run over that same repair-pending state reports `"action":"repair_needed"`.
Every list is sorted and the whole envelope is byte-identical across runs under a
pinned `--transaction-time`.

## Cross-domain attribution

1. **Seed** the owned set from `RepositoryIndex` (read-only reuse): code-graph
   containment (`owner_of` over `CONTAINS`/`DEFINES`/`IMPORTS`), `SemanticDrift`
   (via `DRIFTS_FROM`), and log records (the `repository_id` payload field,
   issue #362).
2. **Extend** by walking the cross-domain **evidence** subgraph undirected from
   the seed. The traversed label set is an exhaustive partition of every
   `EdgeLabel` variant (a `match` with no wildcard arm — the #247 completeness
   invariant), mirroring the `evidence-path` evidence set: evidence links, log
   topology, and the project registry are TRAVERSED; code-graph topology and
   intra-agent-memory / semantic scaffolding are EXCLUDED. A non-seed record
   reached from exactly ONE repository is attributed to it; the walk never
   expands through another repository's seed node, so ownership never bleeds
   across repositories.
3. Each attributed content record is tombstoned; the containment edges from the
   repository to its evicted content are tombstoned too.

The **repository identity node is itself tombstoned** (catalog-clean eviction):
the whole repository — not just its contents — disappears from the catalog
surface. Provenance is not lost — the eviction event references the evicted
identity by its record-ID handle (a string, not a live node), so the audit trail
survives.

**Consequence for `--repo <evicted>`.** Because the identity node is gone from
every serving lane, an evicted repository no longer resolves as a `--repo`
selector on query lanes: `eg query symbol <name> --repo <evicted-selector>` exits
**1** with an `unknown_repository_selector` diagnostic (the selector is now
genuinely unknown), NOT a scoped in-repo no-match. To prove zero leakage, use an
UNSCOPED lane: the evicted repository's symbols never appear in
`eg query symbol <name>`, and its `Repository` record is absent from every
current-state read.

`eg forget-repo` itself keeps resolving an evicted selector for its own
**idempotent** re-run: it resolves against the history-inclusive view with
eviction tombstones stripped and keys the no-op on the surviving eviction EVENT,
so a second `--confirm` reports `already_evicted` (never a second event or
tombstone) even though the identity node is tombstoned.

### Verify-and-repair (mirrors #231 `eg forget`)

The no-op is only reported once the re-run VERIFIES the prior eviction still
suppresses the repository. On finding the eviction event, `forget-repo`
recomputes attribution over the current-state view: if every tombstone-
suppressible attributed record is still suppressed it is a true no-op
(`already_evicted`, nothing written); but if any such record is **live again** —
a crash between the event write and the tombstone writes, or records revived by a
later re-scan/re-ingest — the re-run **repairs** by re-issuing tombstones for the
currently-live records **without writing a second eviction event** (the original
is preserved verbatim). `--confirm` reports `action: repaired`; a dry-run over the
same state reports `action: repair_needed`. A commit-anchored temporal
(`scan-history`) code snapshot — the documented residual a base-ID tombstone can
never suppress — is excluded from the repair trigger, so a re-run over a
`scan-history` store settles to `already_evicted` instead of looping.

## The eviction event

Exactly one auditable event is written per `--confirm` run: a reused
`NodeKind::Retraction` node (agent-memory domain, **no schema bump**) whose prior
handle (`source_handle`) is the repository identity record ID, `agent_id` is the
redacted `--evicted-by`, `text` is the redacted `--reason`, and
`transaction_time` is the pinned/`now` instant. Its record ID is deterministic in
a distinct namespace from #231 retractions
(`agent_memory_stable_id(["node","repo_eviction",<repo_id>])`), so the two event
kinds never collide. Each evicted record additionally gets its own domain-scoped
tombstone whose ID is a pure function of the target handle. The event is written
before the tombstones so the deletions are the latest writes and stay active.

## Honest-gap contract

Attribution is never guessed. A record with **no derivable attribution** — a
legacy `log:v2:` `ErrorSignature` with an empty `repository_id`, an orphan
artifact with no evidence edge — is REPORTED under `unattributable` and NEVER
evicted. A record reachable from TWO OR MORE repositories is SHARED, reported
under `shared_cross_repo`, and NEVER evicted. A **surviving** record that merely
cites an evicted handle over an evidence edge is KEPT; the now-dangling link is
reported under `cross_repo_citations`, never silently dropped or cascade-evicted
(consistent with `eg forget`'s stale-evidence discipline).

## Temporal-store residual (scan-history)

On a **non-temporal** (`eg scan`) store, eviction is clean and complete: a base-ID
tombstone excludes each evicted node (and its edges) from every current-state
read.

On a **`scan-history`** store, code nodes are commit-anchored (temporal), and
here eviction has a **documented residual**: the shared `read_all_records` path
re-emits every per-commit code snapshot with **no tombstone check**, so a base-ID
tombstone does NOT suppress an evicted repository's temporal code snapshots from
the current-state (HEAD-anchored) code serving lanes.

**Why the residual exists.** That same shared read path deliberately serves issue
#231 `eg forget`'s `--at`-after-deletion **bi-temporal honesty** (a historical
`--at <commit>` view must still see a record deleted later). An eviction tombstone
cannot be distinguished from a `forget` tombstone at the read layer without a new
schema field or a repository-ownership recompute in the hot path — both out of
scope for this slice — and there is no distinct per-commit version ID to tombstone
anyway. A physical purge would require an `aletheiadb` capability that does not
exist. Bi-temporal honesty in fact WANTS the historical `--at <commit>` snapshots
preserved; the open question is only the HEAD-anchored current-state read.

**The residual is disclosed, never silent.** Every plan and report — dry-run and
`--confirm` alike — carries a `temporal_snapshots_retained` section enumerating
(count + representative record IDs) exactly the commit-anchored code records that
remain visible. On a non-temporal store the section is empty. The
non-temporal records and the `Repository` identity node are fully evicted; only
commit-anchored code snapshots persist in current-state code lanes. A follow-up
issue (#472) tracks the full fix (a read-layer distinction or physical purge).

Read-only in dry-run, redaction-safe (record IDs, domains, kinds, handles,
counts, and the redacted reason/actor only), deterministic and byte-identical
across runs.
