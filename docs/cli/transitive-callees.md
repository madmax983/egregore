# eg query transitive-callees

Walk the transitive outbound callees/dependencies of a symbol — "what does this
reach, and by which dependency path?" — the outbound mirror of
`eg query transitive-callers` (issue #253).

## Synopsis

```text
eg query transitive-callees <HANDLE> --graph <PATH>   [--repo <SELECTOR>] [--max-depth N] [--at <COMMIT> | --as-of <RFC3339>] [--format json|text]
eg query transitive-callees <HANDLE> --data-dir <DIR> [--repo <SELECTOR>] [--max-depth N] [--at <COMMIT> | --as-of <RFC3339>] [--format json|text]
```

The depth-1 verb answers "what does this depend on directly"
(`eg query deps`, issue #123). This verb owns the multi-hop outbound closure:
it returns every symbol reachable from the target through a chain of outbound
`CALLS`/`IMPLEMENTS`/`IMPORTS`/`REFERENCES` edges, **with the connecting
dependency path for each**, so an agent can tell when the target reaches a
particular subsystem, import, or trait implementation through a 2–3-hop chain
the one-hop query never surfaces — without hand-looping the direct query and
losing the path. It reuses the transitive-callers BFS/path/truncation/cycle
machinery, traversing the outbound edge direction over the wider #123 label
set.

Rows are reachability **leads, not breakage proof**: a dependency path existing
in the graph never asserts that a reachable symbol is exercised at runtime,
that a change will break it, or that the list is complete. Absence of a path is
likewise not proof of independence (dynamic dispatch, macro-generated calls,
FFI, and cross-crate targets are outside the extraction contract).

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `<HANDLE>` | yes | Stable symbol record ID (`codegraph:vN:<hex>`) or exact symbol name. File paths and task/source handles are rejected (exit `1`). |
| `--graph <PATH>` | one of | Graph JSONL produced by `eg scan` or `eg scan-history`. |
| `--data-dir <DIR>` | one of | Embedded `AletheiaDB` store populated by `eg ingest --adapter embedded`. |
| `--repo <SELECTOR>` | no | Restrict symbol resolution — and `--at`/`--as-of` commit resolution — to one repository (see [query.md](query.md#repository-scope---repo-issue-67)). |
| `--max-depth N` | no | Outbound walk bound in hops. Default `5`; must be ≥ 1. |
| `--at <COMMIT>` | no | Walk the graph state at this commit SHA or unique prefix (requires a history store). Mutually exclusive with `--as-of`. |
| `--as-of <RFC3339>` | no | Walk the graph state at the most recent commit at or before this instant. Mutually exclusive with `--at`. |
| `--format` | no | `json` (default) or `text`. |

## Traversal semantics

- **Edges walked:** outbound `CALLS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `IMPORTS`, and
  `REFERENCES` — the `eg query deps` (#123) dependency label set. Weak
  `MENTIONS` edges and containment topology are excluded, so the
  `--max-depth=1` reachable-plus-unresolved result is **exactly** the direct
  outbound dependency set of `eg query deps` (no double-counting, no drift).
- **Shortest paths, deterministic:** the walk is a level-synchronized BFS.
  Each reachable node is reported **once**, at its shortest hop distance, with
  one concrete shortest connecting path chosen deterministically (minimum
  `(parent record ID, edge record ID)` at the discovering depth). Output is
  byte-identical across repeated runs on an unchanged store.
- **Cycles terminate:** a visited set guarantees mutual recursion neither
  loops nor duplicates a node; the queried symbol is never reported as its own
  transitive callee (a recursive self-call is excluded).
- **Explicit `unresolved` category:** an outbound edge whose target is an
  unresolved-call `Diagnostic` marker, carries an `unresolved` resolution
  status, or names a record missing from the store is reported in a distinct
  `unresolved` category — **never silently dropped, and never counted as a
  reachable node** (AC4). Unresolved targets discovered from any source node
  within the depth bound are reported.
- **Resolution propagation (issues #152/#134):** every path step exposes the
  `resolution` label its `CALLS` edge carries (`resolved` / `ambiguous` /
  `unresolved`), and each reachable row carries `path_resolution` — the
  **weakest** status along its chain (`unresolved` > `ambiguous` > `resolved`).
  A path that crosses an ambiguous edge is only as trustworthy as that edge,
  and the row says so. `path_resolution` is omitted when no step on the path is
  inside the resolution contract (e.g. a pure `IMPLEMENTS`/`IMPORTS`/
  `REFERENCES` chain or legacy edges).
- **Truncation is explicit:** reaching `--max-depth` with reachable nodes still
  undiscovered emits a `truncation` diagnostic counting the dropped frontier
  per depth — never a silent omission.

## Handle resolution

Same structural contract as the other code-handle verbs, with one deliberate
tightening: an exact name that matches **more than one live symbol** is
ambiguous for this verb (exit `1`, all candidate record IDs listed), because
walking the union would bleed an unrelated same-name symbol's edges into the
target's reachability. Re-run with one of the reported record IDs, or scope
with `--repo`.

## Output format

### `--format json` (default) — newline-delimited JSON

Line 1 is a summary envelope; every following line is one reachable row
(`category: "reachable"`, canonically ordered by `(hop, record_id)`
ascending), then one line per unresolved target (`category: "unresolved"`,
ordered by `(relation, target_record_id, edge_record_id)`). An empty reachable
set is an explicit success: the envelope reports `total_reachable: 0` and
exit `0`.

Summary envelope fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ok` | bool | `true` on success. |
| `handle` | string | The handle as supplied. |
| `target` | object | The resolved symbol: `record_id`, `schema_version`, `name`, `kind`, `repo_relative_path`, `span`. |
| `direction` | string | Always `"outbound"`. |
| `edge_labels` | array | Always `["CALLS","IMPLEMENTS","IMPORTS","REFERENCES"]`. |
| `max_depth` | number | Bound in effect. |
| `at_commit` | string | Present with `--at`/`--as-of`: the resolved commit SHA. |
| `as_of` | string | Present with `--as-of`: the instant as supplied. |
| `total_reachable` | number | Reachable row count. |
| `total_unresolved` | number | Unresolved row count. |
| `disclaimer` | string | Leads-not-proof statement, always present. |
| `truncation` | object | Present only when the bound dropped reachable nodes: `code` (`max_depth_truncated`), `max_depth`, `dropped_frontier` (array of `{depth, count}`), `dropped_total`. |
| `diagnostics` | array | Stable machine-readable diagnostics (redaction gates). |

Reachable row fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `category` | string | Always `"reachable"`. |
| `record_id` | string | Stable record ID of the reachable node. |
| `schema_version` | number | Record schema version. |
| `name` / `kind` | string | Symbol name and node kind. |
| `repo_relative_path` / `span` | string / object | Citable file/span handle. |
| `valid_time` / `git_commit` | string | Temporal provenance, when the record carries it (history views). |
| `hop` | number | Shortest hop distance from the target (≥ 1). |
| `path_resolution` | string | Weakest `CALLS` resolution along the path; omitted when no step carries one. |
| `path` | array | Ordered connecting chain from the target OUT to this row. Each step: `source_record_id`, `edge_record_id`, `edge_label`, `resolution` (when carried), `target_record_id`. The first step starts at the queried target, the last ends at the row's own record, and consecutive steps share their middle record ID. |
| `trust` | string | Always `"reachability_lead"`. |

Unresolved row fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `category` | string | Always `"unresolved"`. |
| `relation` | string | The producing edge label. |
| `reason` | string | `unresolved_call` (Diagnostic marker or `unresolved` edge) or `missing_target` (dangling/tombstoned target). |
| `record_id` / `name` / `kind` / `repo_relative_path` / `span` | — | The Diagnostic marker's citable handle, when in-graph. |
| `target_record_id` | string | The raw target record ID carried by the edge. |
| `source_record_id` | string | The reachable node this unresolved edge departs from. |
| `source_hop` | number | Hop distance of the source node (0 = the anchor). |
| `resolution` | string | The edge's resolution status, when present. |
| `edge_record_id` | string | The producing edge's stable record ID. |
| `trust` | string | Always `"reachability_lead"`. |

The output never includes raw source text, patch hunks, transcript text, or
protected-artifact payloads — record IDs, names, paths, spans, and counts
only.

### `--format text`

One human-readable line per reachable row (name, location, hop, chain) and per
unresolved target. The exact format is not stable and must not be parsed by
scripts.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Walk completed — including an explicit empty reachable set. |
| `1` | Malformed or unsupported handle (empty, malformed canonical ID, file/task/source handle, non-symbol record), ambiguous symbol name (candidates listed on stderr), unknown/ambiguous `--repo` selector, `--max-depth 0`, ambiguous `--at` prefix, or an invalid `--as-of` timestamp. Machine-readable JSON on stderr. |
| `2` | Handle resolves to no live record (`no_match` / `stale_handle`), `--at` names no commit (`missing_commit`), `--as-of` predates all commits (`no_commit_at_or_before`), or the store has no history (`empty_history`). Machine-readable envelope on stdout. |

## Temporal views (`--at` / `--as-of`)

Over a `scan-history` graph or an ingested history store, the walk runs against
the single-commit snapshot the selector names, reusing recorded history output
without touching Git state or the working tree. `--as-of` resolves to the most
recent commit whose valid time is at or before the instant; the envelope's
`at_commit` reports which commit answered. When `--repo` is set, commit
resolution happens within the selected repository (matching `eg query deps` and
`eg query transitive-callers`).

## Corpus scope

**Changed default (issue #427).** With **neither** `--at`/`--as-of` nor a corpus
flag, over a `scan-history` store this lane now defaults to the **HEAD-anchored**
corpus — records current at each repository's stamped HEAD commit — so a callee
or edge removed before HEAD no longer appears. This flips the pre-#427 default,
which read the **union** of all commit snapshots. Pass `--all-history` to opt
back into that union; pass `--at-head` to force the HEAD-anchored view
explicitly. The summary envelope discloses `corpus_mode` / `corpus_mode_source` /
`corpus_disclaimer`. `--at-head` and `--all-history` are mutually exclusive with
each other and with `--at`/`--as-of` (exit `1`, `unsupported_combination`). See
[Corpus scope for query lanes](corpus-modes.md).

eg scan . --out graph.jsonl

## Out of scope (this slice)

- The inbound direction — transitive callers / "what can reach this" — is owned
  by [transitive-callers.md](transitive-callers.md) (issue #139).
- Joining reachable nodes to public-API/visibility (#124) or test (#126) sets.
- Risk scoring, ranking, test selection, or root-cause inference.
- New extraction: no cross-crate resolution, macro expansion, or trait
  dispatch beyond the edges `scan` already emits.
